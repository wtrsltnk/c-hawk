To build this with TCC, just run the build.cmd. This needs TCC on your 
evironment PATH. When no 'tcc-config.bat' is present, it will call 
'tcc-find.bat' to create this configuration. This will also create a 'bin' and
 a 'obj' folder where the compiled files will be placed.
 
 This project is dependent on scintilla. Download the latest release of 
 scintilla @ https://sourceforge.net/projects/scintilla/files/scintilla/ and
 extract the downloaded zip into the root of this project folder.
